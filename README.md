# Basic Data Analysis Tools

## **Description of the Project**

This project demonstrates a basic analysis of IoT sales data. It includes:
- Loading sales data from a CSV file.
- Data preparation: cleaning and handling missing or invalid entries.
- Statistical analysis to calculate the **Mean**, **Median**, and **Mode** of sales data.
- Visualization of the calculated statistical measures using a bar chart.

The goal is to provide insights into sales trends and present the data analysis visually for easier interpretation.
